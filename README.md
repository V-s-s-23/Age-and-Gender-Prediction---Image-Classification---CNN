# About DataSet:-
###  UTKFace dataset is a large-scale face dataset with long age span (range from 0 to 116 years old). The dataset consists of over 20,000 face images with annotations of age, gender, and ethnicity. The images cover large variation in pose, facial expression, illumination, occlusion, resolution, etc. This dataset could be used on a variety of tasks, e.g., face detection, age estimation, age progression/regression, landmark localization, etc. The objective of the project is to detect gender and age using facial images. Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the images. There are 2 output types namely, gender(M or F) and age.

 # CNN Model:-
 ## I have built an Age and Gender Classification CNN Model with an accuracy of 90%. During the model-building process, I followed several steps to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model.Firstly, I extracted the labels of age and gender and then performed some exploratory data analysis to understand the age and gender distribution. Additionally, I visualized the images to better understand the data.After this, I built the CNN model with an accuracy of 90%.
